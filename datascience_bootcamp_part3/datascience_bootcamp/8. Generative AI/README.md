## Project 8

- ðŸ“Š **Generative AI**: This project explored the world of generative AI, focusing particularly on Large Language Models (LLMs).
    
- ðŸ“‘ **Case Study to Data Analysis**:
    
    This project empowers me to become a trailblazer by building a powerful AI chatbot in Streamlit that solves a real-world problem of my choice.
