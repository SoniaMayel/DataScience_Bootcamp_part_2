## Project 10
- üìä **Deep Learning**: A project in Tensorflow environment using Python.
    

    Deep Learning shines with massive datasets containing images, video or text. However, these datasets come with additional complexities to solve.


    While Scikit-Learn is the obvious choice for ‚Äúclassical‚Äù Machine Learning in Python, the world of Deep Learning has two ‚Äúcompeting‚Äù frameworks: PyTorch and Tensorflow, developed by the AI teams of Facebook and Google respectively ‚Äîand made open-source.

    Traditionally, Pytorch has been the preferred framework for research while Tensorflow has had a wider adoption in the industry. Nowadays, though, both frameworks are very similar and can be used everywhere. We will use Tensorflow because after its merge with Keras (a very user-friendly Deep Learning library) it has become easier to play with and has exploded in popularity.

    There are two ways to code using Tensorflow: with a Google Colaboratory notebook, or installing it localy on computer.


- üìë **Case Study to Data Analysis**:
    
    It‚Äôs time to implement a Neural Network. I tried to solve the same challenge I tackled with classic Machine Learning algorithms: predicting housing prices.


- üíª **Project Setup**:

    Here are the steps I followed:

    - 1. Import Tensorflow
    - 2. Convert the data to tensors
    - 3. Define the layers of your model
    - 4. Compile the model
    Here I defined three things:
     * The optimizer:
     * The learning rate: 
     * The loss function: 
    - 5. Fit the model
    - 6. Plot the loss
    - 7. Iterate
    - 8. Check the performance on the test set

    Here is also another question: does the model perform better than the classical Machine Learning models I built using Scikit-Learn? Then Neural Networks are predominantly used for tasks like Computer Vision for a reason: they shine with that kind of data.
